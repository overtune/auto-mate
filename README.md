# Auto mate web component

This is an experiment to help automate form filling.  
You can specify an selector for a form and this component will fill that form.  
If it can't find the form it will wait for it to be present.

## Usage

Just import the init script on a page and it will take care of the rest.

```html
<script src="./init.js" type="module"></script>
```
